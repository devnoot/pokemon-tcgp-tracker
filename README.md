# Pokemon TCGP Tracker

I wrote this app to help keep track of what cards I am missing in the [Pokemon TCGP](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/) app. This app allows you to search for and add cards to your collection, which is stored in your browser's local starge. It will also tell you how many cards left you have in each collection.

The card list currently has the Charizard, Mewtwo, Pikachu, and Promo A decks. I'll try to keep the deck list updated as more cards are releaed.
